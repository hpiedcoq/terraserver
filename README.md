# Terraserver

This is a personnal intent to slightly enhance the UI of the preview window of Terraserver in order to have a bigger usable area in you web browser.

##Installation

Open your firefox personnal profile : 

###Linux

Profile folders are located here:

    ~/.mozilla/firefox/<profile folder> 

The ".mozilla" folder is a hidden folder. See this article for more information. To show hidden files in Nautilus (Gnome desktop's default file browser), choose "View -> Show Hidden Files".

###Mac

Profile folders are in one of these locations:

    ~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/<profile folder>
    ~/Library/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles/<profile folder> 

The tilde character (~) refers to the current user's Home folder, so ~/Library is the /Macintosh HD/Users/<username>/Library folder.

For OS X 10.7 Lion and above, the ~/Library folder is hidden by default. See this article to make it appear. 

###Windows

On Windows 2000 and Windows XP, profile folders are in this location, by default:

    C:\Documents and Settings\<Windows login/user name>\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\<profile folder> 

The Application Data folder is a hidden folder; to show hidden folders, open Windows Explorer and choose "Tools → Folder Options → View (tab) → Show hidden files and folders".

On Windows Vista and above, profile folders are in this location, by default:

    C:\Users\<Windows login/user name>\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\<profile folder>. 

The AppData folder is a hidden folder; to show hidden folders, open a Windows Explorer window and choose "Organize → Folder and Search Options → Folder Options → View (tab) → Show hidden files and folders".

You can also use this path to find the profile folder, even when it is hidden:

    %APPDATA%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\<profile folder> 

%APPDATA% is a variable represents the C:\Documents and Settings\<user name>Application Data folder on Windows 2000/XP and the C:\Users\<user name>\AppData\Roaming folder on Windows Vista and above.

To find a profile folder in the default location on Windows:

    Press "Windows key Image:Windows_Key.png + R" to open the Run box
    (or, you can click "Start → Run..." on Windows 2000/XP)
    In the Run box, type in %APPDATA%
    Click OK. A Windows Explorer window will appear.
    In this window, choose Mozilla → Firefox → Profiles. 

Each folder in the "Profiles" folder (e.g., "xxxxxxxx.default") is a profile on your computer. 



Create a new directory inside this directory called "Chrome" (please respect the lower C)

Save the file here.

Restart your browser.
Done.
